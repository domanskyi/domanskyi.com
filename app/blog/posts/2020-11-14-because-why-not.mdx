I have thought about starting my website a long time ago. But I did not found any reasons why I need to do it. In September I saw Luke Smith's video [Get a Website Now! Don't be a Web Peasant!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdKZVIGRAKQ) where he proposed one good argument - anyone needs to be a landlord. And if I do not have enough time and money to buy my land - why I can not do it on the Internet almost for free?
I know that my English is pretty bad. I have finished English courses about 6 years ago, but since that time I almost did not have practice in grammar. So this blog is also a good opportunity to practice it.
